## Notes
**1**. Web support is provided for development purposes.
Although it may function as intended in production, it has not been reviewed thoroughly for any security flaws. 
It's a simple HTTP based client library that communicates directly with Stripe's API Servers without using their 
official SDKs. Use at your own risk.
